# Number Rotation Puzzle Solver

Hello!  Welcome!  I have no idea how to use Github!

Anyways, the code for thhe solver is here if you want.  Just note that there is currently a bug.  I'll get to it eventually, but for now all I can guarantee is that for most values of N, this algorithm will run perfectly.

REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING THE PROGRAM:  You need to have Python 3, and have pygame installed as well.
